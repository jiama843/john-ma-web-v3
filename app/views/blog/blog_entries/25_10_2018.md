This is a test to see how markdown is rendered in html.

cout << "Test" << endl;

## Testing header 2

Looks about right.

Let's test a hackerrank question:

~~~
// New year's chaos
// IDEA: Reverse the problem
// start from the front,
// if a number is greater than the next
// swap their positions
// continue until equal with original positions
// Each swap can be added to hash table
void minimumBribes(vector <int> line){
  vector <int> control(line.size(), init(consecutive));
  map <int, int> bribes;
  int minswaps = 0;
  while(line != control){
    for(i = 0; i < line.size() - 1; i++){
      if(line[i] > line[i+1]){
        if(bribes[line[i]] > 2){
          cout << "Too Chaotic" << endl;
          return;
        }
        swap(line[i], line[i+1]);
        bribes[line[i]]++;
        minswaps++;
      }
    }
  }
  cout << minswaps << endl;
}

## How this was set up

This was accomplished using a base blog template that would be rendered with a parameter called <filename>.
The <filename> is read from and converted into html using the Kramdown gem.

With this configuration, to add a new entry:

1. Create a new blog entry markdown file with right naming convention
2. Add a new blog div (copy paste and change parameter)

That's about it. Works like a charm.
